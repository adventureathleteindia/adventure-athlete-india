## Business Model: Himalayan Adventure Concierge

**Core positioning:** You're not a tour operator. You're a **trusted local insider** who connects travelers with vetted, quality-assured experiences. Your athlete credentials and local knowledge are the trust signal.

### Your Commitment
- **Time:** 15-25 hrs/week (part-time but serious)
- **Guiding days:** 4-6 days/month personally
- **Target income:** ₹1-2 Lakh/month within 6 months

### Your Rate
- **Personal guiding fee:** ₹10,000/day (premium service)
- **Reference:** German-speaking guides in Delhi charge ₹10K/day for language skills alone
- **Your value:** National-level athlete credentials + deep local Himalayan knowledge + authentic adventure

## Shop Section (Product Sales via Partners)

### The Model
You're a **lead generator**, not a seller. Zero inventory, zero liability.

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | You partner with premium bike dealers/stores |
| 2 | You list their bikes on website (gallery with specs, photos, prices) |
| 3 | Customer sees bike → contacts you via website/WhatsApp |
| 4 | You connect customer to dealer |
| 5 | Dealer handles sale, delivery, warranty, after-service |
| 6 | Dealer pays YOU commission for the referral |

**Key principles:**
- Customer buys FROM the dealer (not from you)
- Your commission comes FROM the dealer (not marked up to customer)
- You never touch inventory, never handle payment, zero liability
- Same model works for brand partnerships (Scott, Trek, Giant)

### Website Implementation
- Section name: **"Shop"**
- Simple gallery with product cards (photo, name, specs, price)
- "Inquire" button → opens WhatsApp or contact form
- Updated manually by Claude when dealer inventory changes
- No e-commerce, no checkout, no inventory sync needed

### Target Partners

| Category | Target Brands/Dealers | Commission Model |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| Premium MTB | Scott, Trek, Giant dealers | ₹5-15K per bike sold |
| Mid-range bikes | Firefox, Ninety One | ₹2-5K per bike sold |
| Gear & accessories | Decathlon, local shops | 10-15% of sale value |

### How to Pitch Dealers

> "I'm a 5x National MTB Champion running adventure experiences in Shimla. Tourists and athletes regularly ask me for bike recommendations. I'd like to formalize a partnership where I refer buyers to your dealership and earn a commission on completed sales. I also showcase products on my website to a targeted adventure audience."

Attach Athlete Profile PDF (`design/athlete-profile/athlete-profile.html`).

### Phase Roadmap

| Phase | What | When |
|-------|------|------|
| **Phase 1** | "Gear I Ride" page — list your personal equipment with dealer links | Now |
| **Phase 2** | Partner with 1-2 dealers, list their inventory in Shop section | Month 2-3 |
| **Phase 3** | Add brand partnerships (Scott, Trek) with official ambassador status | Month 6+ |

---

## Brand Partnership Strategy

### What You Offer Brands

| Asset | Value to Brand |
|-------|----------------|
| Athlete credentials | 5x National MTB Champion, ITRA 555, licensed guide |
| Content creation | Himalayan riding photos/videos featuring their bikes |
| Local ambassador | THE face of adventure cycling in Shimla region |
| Sales channel | Tourists and locals ask "what bike should I buy?" |
| Event presence | Represent them at local races/events |

### What to Ask For

| Ask | Typical Deal |
|-----|--------------|
| Product support | Free or discounted bikes/gear for personal use |
| Referral commission | 5-10% on sales you drive to dealers |
| Ambassador fee | ₹10-50K/month (requires larger following) |
| Co-branded experiences | "Scott x Adventure Athlete India" rides |

### Realistic Starting Point
1. **Product at cost** — brands love Himalayan content with their bikes
2. **Dealer referral deal** — ₹5-10K per bike sold through your referral
3. **Logo on website** — "Proud to ride Scott" builds YOUR credibility

### Target Approach
- Start with **one brand** (whichever you currently ride)
- Build relationship, get results, then expand
- Contact local dealer first (they have discretion), not corporate

## Notes

- Start with ₹10K/day guiding rate — can raise as demand proves itself
- Groups are the path to higher daily revenue (3-4 people = ₹30-40K/day)
- Hotel partnerships are fastest path to first bookings
- Don't need perfect systems to start — WhatsApp + pamphlets is enough
- Family members can help with coordination as volume grows
- Shop section is a future revenue stream — focus on tours/services first for immediate income
