### 5. Why AAI Page

**Intro:**
```
Not just another tour company.
An athlete who happens to guide.
```

**Differentiators:**

🏠 **LOCAL KNOWLEDGE**
I grew up here. These aren't trails I researched — they're trails I've ridden and run for years. I know the shortcuts, the views, the spots that don't show up on maps.

🏆 **ATHLETE FIRST**
I race competitively — MTB nationals, trail runs, ultra events. When I guide you, I understand pacing, nutrition, altitude, and what your body needs. Not just directions.

🎯 **PERSONALIZED, NOT PACKAGED**
No fixed itineraries. Your fitness. Your interests. Your time. I design around you — for a pure adventure in the mountains.

🏔️ **BEYOND THE OBVIOUS**
I've taken my bike to summits no one's ridden before. I'm always exploring new routes. You get access to trails that aren't on anyone's list.

🎫 **LICENSED & LEGIT**
Official HP Tourism Guide. Proper permits, proper safety. You're in responsible hands.

🤝 **YOU GET ME**
This isn't an agency where you book online and meet a random guide. When you book with Adventure Athlete India, you get me. Personal attention, real connection, shared passion.

## New Features (Unified Launch)

### 13. Tours & Programs Page

**Route:** `/tours-programs`
**Nav placement:** Standalone top-level nav item between "Experiences" and "About"

**Hero:**
- Image: Old Himalayan village rooftops (stone/slate roofs, mountain backdrop — intimidating feel)
- Title: "TOURS & PROGRAMS"
- Subtitle: "Multi-day adventures, village experiences, and wellness retreats — designed around you."

**Program Cards:**
Each program gets a card with:
- Hero image
- Title (e.g., "Shimla to Dharamshala Bike Tour")
- Duration badge (e.g., "4 Days")
- Type tag (Bike Tour / Village Experience / High Altitude / Wellness)
- Short description (2-3 lines)
- Difficulty indicator
- Best season
- "Enquire Now" CTA button → links to Plan Your Adventure form

**Programs to list at launch:**

| Program | Type | Duration | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| Shimla → Dharamshala Bike Tour | Bike Tour | 4 days | Multi-day cycling tour through the Himalayan foothills |
| Manali → Leh High Altitude Ride | High Altitude | Multi-day | Epic high-pass cycling adventure in Ladakh |
| Village Base Camp | Village Experience | 3-7 days | Slow life — orchards, trail runs, local exploration from a village base |
| Wellness Retreat | Wellness | Varies | Yoga/wellness retreat facilitated through local partners |
| Train with a Pro | Coaching | Custom (3-14 days) | Partner pro athletes coach cycling/trail running; Atul facilitates logistics |

**Key difference from Experiences page:** No Strava embed, no GPX data, no journal-style content. These are *offerings*, not documented routes. Clean program descriptions with practical info.

**"Enquire Now" CTA:** All program cards link to `/plan-tour` (separate tour inquiry form, not the day experience form).

**Bottom CTA:** "Not sure which program suits you? Let's talk." → `/plan-tour`

---

### 14. Equipment Rentals Page

**Route:** `/rentals`
**Nav placement:** Standalone top-level nav item

**Hero:**
- Image: Mountain bike and skis against mountain backdrop
- Title: "EQUIPMENT RENTALS"
- Subtitle: "Quality gear for every terrain."

**Equipment Catalog:**
One unified catalog under Adventure Athlete India (no partner branding visible — you handle sourcing behind the scenes).

Each equipment card:
- Photo
- Name / model
- Key specs (suspension type, wheel size, ski type, etc.)
- Day rate or "Enquire for pricing"
- "Book This" CTA → WhatsApp / contact

**Launch inventory:**
- Full Suspension Trail Bike (Scott Genius) — 29" wheels, air fork, dropper post
- Hardtail Mountain Bike (Scott/Giant) — 27.5" wheels, air fork, disc brakes
- 1 pair of skis (brand/type/conditions)
- Future: motorcycles, campers, expanded partner inventory

**Rental Terms section:**
7 terms displayed with green checkmark icons:
1. Valid government-issued ID required at pickup
2. Advance payment of 50% required to confirm booking
3. Equipment must be returned in the same condition
4. Renter is responsible for any damage during rental period
5. Helmet is mandatory and included with all bike rentals
6. Late returns will be charged at the daily rate
7. Cancellation: Full refund if cancelled 48+ hours before rental date

**Rental Agreement Form:**
Hidden by default, revealed via "View Rental Agreement Form" link. Sections:
- Personal Details: Full Name, Email, Phone/WhatsApp
- ID Verification: ID Type dropdown (Aadhaar/Passport/Driving License/Other), ID Number
- Rental Details: Equipment Selected dropdown, Rental From date, Rental To date
- Emergency Contact: Name, Phone Number

**How It Works section:**
3 steps: Browse → Contact me → I arrange it for you

**Bottom CTA:** "Need help choosing the right gear? Get in touch."

---

### 15. Map View (on Experiences Page)

**Location:** Toggle on the existing Experiences page (not a standalone page)

**Design:**
- Toggle buttons at the top: **Grid** | **Map** (next to filter pills)
- Grid view = current card layout (default)
- Map view = full-width Leaflet + OpenStreetMap interactive map

**Map behavior:**
- Pins for all experiences using lat/lng coordinates (added to experience data)
- Click a pin → popup card with image, title, distance, elevation, difficulty, "View" link
- Category filter pills work in map view — hide/show pins
- Map centered on Shimla region by default, zooms to fit all visible pins

**Tech:** Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles. Free, no API key, ~50KB. Lazy-loaded only when map view is toggled.

**Data change:** Add `latitude` and `longitude` fields to each experience in `experiences.ts`.

---

### 16. Testimonials Section (on Home Page)

**Location:** Home page section below "Why Adventure Athlete India" and above the CTA section. Not a standalone page.

**Design:**
- Section label: "WHAT PEOPLE SAY"
- Carousel of testimonial cards (3 visible on desktop, 1 on mobile, arrows to scroll)
- Each card: quote text, reviewer name, location (e.g., "Sarah M., London"), star rating (optional)
- Clean design — no heavy borders, just quote marks and subtle card styling

**Empty state:** Section simply doesn't render when no testimonials exist (no "coming soon" — that looks unprofessional).

**Data:** Array in `testimonials.ts`. When the first review is added, the section appears automatically.

```typescript
// website/lib/testimonials.ts
interface Testimonial {
  quote: string;
  name: string;
  location: string;       // e.g., "London, UK"
  rating?: number;        // 1-5 stars, optional
  experienceSlug?: string; // link to specific experience
}
```

---

### 17. GPX Download with Lead Capture

**Location:** On each Experience Detail page, near the stats dashboard or below the Strava embed.

**Design:**
- Callout box (same style as "My Notes" — grey background, subtle card):
  - Badge: "DOWNLOAD GPX FILE"
  - Text: "Get the full route file for your GPS device."
  - Button: "Get GPX" → opens modal

**Modal:**
- Title: "Download GPX File"
- Fields: Name, Email, WhatsApp (optional)

## Admin Panel (`/admin`)

### Overview

Built-in admin dashboard at `/admin` route, protected by Supabase Auth. Single-user login (Atul only). Zero additional cost (Supabase free tier: 50,000 rows, 500MB).

**No CMS** — content management stays in Claude Code workflow (experience-entry.html → Claude polish → experiences.ts). Admin panel focuses on operations only.

### Security

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth — email + password with bcrypt hashing |
| **Route Protection** | All `/admin/*` routes check for valid session server-side. No session = redirect to login |
| **Rate Limiting** | 5 failed login attempts → 15-minute lockout (Supabase built-in) |
| **HTTPS** | Vercel serves everything over HTTPS by default |
| **API Protection** | Admin API routes require valid Supabase JWT token |
| **Single User** | No registration/signup page. Account created once during setup |
| **Session Expiry** | Auto logout after 24 hours of inactivity |

### Section 1: Dashboard Home (`/admin`)

| Widget | Content |
