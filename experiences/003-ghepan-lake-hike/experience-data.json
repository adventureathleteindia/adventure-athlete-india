    "raw_description": "It was a first hike for me like I did not do multiple days track. I went early morning and came back in the evening. It was around 8 to 10 hours of hike for me. I took some food items like boiled potatoes, eggs, chocolate, peanut butter bread we were three people so took enough for the lunch for three of us., apart from that in the gear, I was having trail learning shoes, jacket, cap, sunglasses, water pack, although there was plenty of water on the trail. The crossing of the water were four in which one of them was very difficult to cross, even in the autumn on the water was less so I think going early makes the water little less because the glacier melts slow in the morning and it gets easier. Ghepan lake in Lahaul Valley of Himachal Pradesh, India (near Sissu)\nStart point: 1 kms above Labrang village (i.e. 3 km from Sissu)\n\nTotal Distance: 23.5 kms\nMax elevation: 4100 m\nGPS route mapping:   / strava  \nElevation gain 1250 M (back and forth)\n\nAlert: The altitude hits you, stream crossing can be challenging in peak seasons, don't underestimate the mountain.\n",
