    "raw_description": "So the raw description about the Shali hike, I just went on a Sunday run taking my car from Dhalli to Khatnol and then 3 km beyond towards the trail head. It was January 11 so it was a winter day. The sun was quite bright, a short sunny day of winters - usually it is snowy in this month but this year due to the dry weather, the trail was dry and there was no snow. I took trail shoes with 1L of water, a pole because the route is very rocky and a pole helps while coming downhill so that we don't tumble our foot. I just took one energy bar with me. Started the journey quite late - I started my run around 1 PM and also shooting all the way, it took me around 50-55 minutes to the top. The most memorable part was the top from where you have a 360° view. Lessons learned is one should start early to enjoy the most out of the day. It was a solo run and would have been fun if there was company. We also get water on the top so no need to worry about water but if it's off-season you must carry some food otherwise there'll be less chances that you get anything on the top. There is a Pujari on the top and you can also put your tent and maybe stay on the top if you have permission from the Pujari.",
