# Adventure Athlete India - Client Brief

## Background

I'm a professional mountain biker and trail runner based in Shimla, India. I have:
- 8 years of mountain biking experience
- 5 National Championships in MTB
- 20+ races with international participants
- 6 years of trail running with ITRA score of 555
- 10+ trail races with podium finishes
- Raced at altitudes up to 4300m

My social media handles:
- Instagram: @adventureathlete.in (1,200 followers)
- YouTube: Adventure Athlete India (1,100 subscribers)
- Facebook: Adventure Athlete India (500 followers)

## The Problem

I don't race much anymore due to limited races in this part of the world and being busy with life. Instead, I explore local trails and new peaks, mostly solo. But my following isn't growing because:
- I post inconsistently (maybe 1-2 times per month)
- I don't have a proper sequence or schedule
- I don't know what my audience wants
- I see normal people going viral while my crazy stuff gets ignored

## What I Want to Build

### 1. Website (adventureathlete.in)

A premium tour website where I can:
- Show my background and credentials
- Offer customized private tours in the Himalayas
- Document all my explorations with route info, photos, GPX files
- Connect Strava for new routes
- Link to my social media for more info

### 2. Tour Offerings

**Personal Tours:**
- Explore Shimla with Me (half-day/full-day) - for tourists
- Weekend Trail Experience (1-2 days) - MTB or running immersion
- Peak Expedition (1-2 days) - fast hikes to local peaks
- High Altitude Training Camp (14 days) - for serious athletes (later phase)

**Corporate Wellness (partner with local providers):**
- Mountain Reset programs
- Adventure team building
- Leadership retreats
- Wellness retreats with yoga partners

Pricing around ₹10-15K per day for premium experiences.

### 3. Content System

I need a systematic schedule to increase engagement. I can give:
- 1 hour daily for editing (9-10 PM)
- Morning workout time for capture (8-10 AM daily)
- Full day on alternate weekends, half day on others

### 4. Route Documentation

When I go out, I want to:
- Know what to capture (a shoot script)
- Document routes with 3 photos (short) or 6-10 photos (epic)
- Sync Strava data (distance, elevation, GPX)
- Add vlogs for epic/famous routes only
- Quality over quantity - maybe 2 epic routes per month

### 5. Goals (12 Months)

- Instagram: 1,200 → 10,000
- YouTube: 1,100 → 10,000
- Tours: 2 per month
- Focus on GROWTH first, leads will follow

## My Equipment

I have everything:
- Smartphone with good camera
- GoPro/action camera
- Drone
- Gimbal/stabilizer
- Editing apps (CapCut, InShot)
- Laptop for editing

## Target Customers

Primary: Adventure tourists (foreigners and city folks) wanting unique Himalayan experiences. Can partner with local hotels for leads.

Secondary (later): Serious athletes for high-altitude training camps.

## Booking Flow

Hybrid approach:
- Guest browses experiences
- Fills questionnaire (fitness level, interests, dates, group size)
- I respond with custom itinerary and quote
- Premium = personalized, not packaged

## Language

- YouTube: Hindi/Hinglish (better engagement)
- Website: English (international tourists)
- Instagram: English with option for Hindi captions

## Notes

- Corporate wellness should look distinct (partner programs)
- Keep it sustainable - I don't want to burn out
- This is part of my lifestyle, not a burden
- Quality over quantity always
